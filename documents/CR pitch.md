America's obsession with online shopping accelerated during the pandemic, and retailers have accommodated the 
surge by expanding their delivery networks dramatically. But next-day e-commerce brings many negative 
externalitiesâ€”including to the neighborhoods that play host to large e-commerce warehouses.
 
A Consumer Reports investigation co-published with The Guardian last year found that Amazon 
operates warehouses in neighborhoods with disproportionate shares of residents of color and 
low-income people. The investigation also found that there's a lack of hyperlocal air monitoring 
that would allow regulators to understand an individual warehouse facility's contribution to pollution 
in its neighborhood. To fill that gap, CR now has access to exclusive block-by-block air quality data, 
gathered over many months in several major California metro areas, plus parts of Brooklyn. CR 
proposes using this data to analyze the air-quality impacts of warehouse traffic.
