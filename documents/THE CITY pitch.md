[Alyssa Katz](https://www.thecity.nyc/authors/alyssa-katz), THE CITY

THE CITY is looking to produce a geographic guide to climate resiliency projects planned and underway around New York City, such as sea walls and berms. We would like to present these along with data visualization about flood and heat risks in NYC neighborhoods so that it is possible to see how resources are being deployed relative to risk. THE CITY's objective is to create a data interactive that our newsroom can update over time.
