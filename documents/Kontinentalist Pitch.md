Death penalty in Singapore

“Disneyland with the death penalty”, the title of a 1993 WIRED essay by writer William Gibson, is sometimes used to 
describe the state’s unapologetic use of capital punishment, especially for drug-related offences. The issue has 
drawn much attention, but discourse about it thus far has carried much heat and little light. How effective is the 
death penalty when it comes to deterrence? Are there statistical fallacies in common arguments for and against the 
death penalty? What do the demographics of those who receive the death penalty tell us? How do other approaches to 
crime, such as rehabilitation, compare in impact—and are they good alternatives?
