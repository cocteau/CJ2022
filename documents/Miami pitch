Florida pedestrian fatalities

Our state continues to be the deadliest for people on foot, and a lot of the blame lies with the 
state Department of Transportation, which regulates road design and pedestrian infrastructure. 
I've done a lot of reporting on this as it relates to pedestrian ticketing and find it to be 
a fascinating and under-covered area. How our street design contributes to people dying on foot 
is a phenomenon that is well understood and the solutions are obvious, but Florida doesn't 
implement any of them because they require slowing down traffic, which is already a huge problem here. 
Meanwhile, the majority of the victims are low-income and people of color.
