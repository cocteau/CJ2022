Changing water temperatures in the Great Lakes are impacting freshwater fish in ways not yet fully understood. 
Few animals are more sensitive to temperature than fish, and different fish species need different temperature 
ranges to thrive. What fish can be caught where will continue to shift over the next few decades due to climate 
change, perhaps dramatically. And that will impact — and could harm — a vital community resource and economic 
driver in Michigan, home of the Detroit Free Press.
