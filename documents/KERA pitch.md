KERA North Texas: The Texas Power Grid

In February 2021, a major winter storm brought the Texas power grid to its knees. Millions of people were left in the dark for days. Hundreds of people died as the temperatures dipped into the single digits in a state that’s not built for that kind of weather. Low-income Texans and communities of color were particularly hard hit.

How could something like this happen in the energy capital of Texas? That’s what KUT, the public radio station in Austin, explored in the first season of a podcast called The Disconnect in 2021. Now, The Texas Newsroom (the collaboration among NPR and the public radio stations in Texas) is working on season two of The Disconnect, which will explore a number of questions: Are power plants more prepared? Is progress being made to prepare the state’s natural gas infrastructure? How will state regulators overhaul the electricity market? Is the Texas grid prepared for more frequent extreme weather expected due to climate change?

There are several possibilities for a meaningful data component for this project, which will be led by Matt Largey at KUT. What do campaign finance reports show us about the influence of the state’s big energy companies on the Texas politicians who make key decisions about the grid? What data might we be able to get from ERCOT (the state grid operator) that could shed light on last year’s crisis and whether the state is prepared for the next big storm?
