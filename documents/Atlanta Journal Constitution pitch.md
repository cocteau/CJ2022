How have Georgia’s coastline, major cities, and overall land use
changed over the last 20 years of climate change and urbanization, and
what can we say about those changes using satellite imagery data? Can
Atlanta still be called the ‘City in the Trees’ after decades of
construction? Can light emissions data tell us something about the
health of rural Georgia that economic and population data can't? What
are the best datasets and methods for answering questions like these?
