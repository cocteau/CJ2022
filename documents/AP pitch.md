**Movement and mobility**

The cheap and fast transportation of people and goods is a fundamental requirement of modern economic life. Supply chain bottlenecks and a suge in work-from-home have put new focus on the vast enterprise of movement that runs  through every part of the country. Beyond raw economic factors there is also the social element of communities  served and under-served by the web of logistics around us, and unresolved questions about what the future will look like.

The AP has also come up with other potential pitches. We've included them here as alternative choices.

1. National stories

>Housing:
<br><br>
HUD works with USPS on collecting 'vacant' or 'no-stat' housing; however, this
data set is full of challenges when it comes to extracting an accurate portrait
of tracking neighborhood level changes. With some effort, a limited portrait of
neighborhood vacancies could probably be combined with Census or other HUD data
sets to tell stories of either urban depopulation or re-vitalization. Example:

<br><br>
Trade:
<br><br>
US Foreign Trade data is available monthly for various points. While the data
does not track the complete path of goods - only the volume at the ports - it
can still be used to illustrate the effect of various supply shocks or demand
changes in terms of the total amount of 'stuff' being imported and exported. It
will require a lot of time understanding the nuances of trade data.
<br><br>
Transportation:
<br><br>
The federal DOT has comprehensive monthly data on all the transit agencies of the
country - various metrics and categorizations, which can be used to answer
questions like "which networks have the highest proportion of fare-beaters."
The data set also allows us to answer COVID related public transit questions.
<br><br>
Along similar lines is the freight rail data set from the STB, which collects
performance metrics for the Class I freight railroads. This can be used to talk
about congestion and (in a very limited way) movements between hubs.
<br><br>
Labor:
<br><br>
OSHA has safety complaint and inspection data, as well as specific breakouts for
COVID-19, industrial air quality, and severe injury reports. This includes
industry labels and county, but the data set is very messy and has a lot of
methodological considerations.
<br><br>

2. NYC specific:

>The NYPD misconduct database. This has been an evolving data set as the NYCLU
and CCRB continue to negotiate release of the data, but it is a comprehensive
repository of complaints made by the public on record at the CCRB.
<br><br>
Motor vehicle crashes - NYC open data has a very messy data set (in terms of
address parsing) of crashes. The good thing about the data set is it has
pedestrians/cyclists/motorists injured/killed, and at least in some cases a
prescribed "contributing factor" that appears to be somewhat standardized
(following closely, driver inattention, etc).
<br><br>
Lastly, a more lighthearted interesting data set, but NYC has a film permit
database. This could be used in a few ways, but mostly to talk about the
most-filmed bits of the city. One question this raises is what areas become
"representative", in terms of what gets portrayed in TV/film, versus what areas don't.
