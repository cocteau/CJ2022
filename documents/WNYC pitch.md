Idea No.1: Our desk has obtained an NYS DOH dataset containing how many COVID-19 vaccine doses were delivered to providers (e.g., pharmacies, clinics) outside of NYC during the first six months of the pandemic. (We're still working on obtaining the data for NYC providers). Regardless, what we have would be perfect for an equity story.

Idea No. 2: The omicron surge is seemingly subsiding in terms of cases, but it could still cause more deaths than past surges if its wave plateaus or if it has a "long tail." In other words, focusing only on the peak might be missing the bigger picture in terms of long-term severity. Our desk is perpetually looking for ways to look at COVID data from a new perspective, and we could pitch some similar ideas in this vein.
